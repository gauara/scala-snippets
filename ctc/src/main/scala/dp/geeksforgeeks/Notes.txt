Group of similar problems

Pattern:-
- Inclusion/Exclusion situation - when item is included and when not included

Steps:-
- Try to make base case - usually pre populate the first row and column
- check for cases when item > j (sum - exclusion) and item == j ( with and w/o item) and item < j (with and w/o case)

Problems:-

- Coin change problem - ways to form a sum using coins of any denomination
- 0/1 Knapsack


MatrixChainMultiplication , LongestPalindromicSubsequence,

IMPORTANT NOTES --

- Make sure to clarify if there is INFINITE supply or NOT, e.g in COIN change problem we have infinite supply and
in 0/1 Knapsack there is no infinite supply which means in INCLUDE case,

YOU have to go previous row as ith ITEM can not be included as there is no infinite supply and if item is selected
and still there is weight left over or remaining you need to get that by using other items CANT use the same item
and hence ith row

- In LongestPalindromicSubsequence we are using (i+1), which means we need to set it up before because wrong values will be read
so make sure when we use things like i+1 or i-1 we need to make sure that those cells are set up and we are not
end up using default values
